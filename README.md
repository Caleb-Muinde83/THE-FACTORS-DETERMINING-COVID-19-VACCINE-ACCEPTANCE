# THE-FACTORS-DETERMINING-COVID-19-VACCINE-ACCEPTANCE
Problem Statement  Despite vaccines being our best weapon in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot of people are doubtful about taking the jab. The factors behind vaccine hesitancy are still unclear and this project seeks to investigate them. In the US  184 million people have been fully vaccinated, thatâ€™s about 56% of the population. With a large proportion of people not fully vaccinated there could be an emergence of variants that are more infectious or deadly. Moreover, there could be an increase in the number of infections that could lead to a reintroduction of lockdown measures that hurt the economy.
