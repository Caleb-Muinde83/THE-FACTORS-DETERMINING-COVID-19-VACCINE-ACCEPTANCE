**Problem Statement**

Despite vaccines being our best weapon in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot of people are doubtful about taking the jab. The factors behind vaccine hesitancy are still unclear and this project seeks to investigate them. In the US  184 million people have been fully vaccinated, that’s about 56% of the population. With a large proportion of people not fully vaccinated there could be an emergence of variants that are more infectious or deadly. Moreover, there could be an increase in the number of infections that could lead to a reintroduction of lockdown measures that hurt the economy.

**Research questions**

Some research questions to be looked into when undertaking the project include the following : 

1. Does the age of a person influence the decision on whether to take the vaccine or not ?
2. Does the financial status of a person influence the decision to take the vaccine or not?
3. Does a person’s level of education influence the decision making of vaccine acceptance ?
4. Does the respondent’s gender in any way correlate with the person’s decision to take the vaccine or not?
